# Sentiment Analysis For Marathi Language

This project presents a sentiment analysis system for Marathi text, utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. The primary focus of the work is on the preprocessing of Marathi text data, which includes tokenization, stop-word removal, and normalization processes tailored to the Marathi language. A Multinomial Naive Bayes model is employed as the predictive mechanism, trained on labeled Marathi text datasets. The model is evaluated based on its ability to accurately classify sentiment across a variety of text samples. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of machine learning methods like Multinomial Naive Bayes in handling sentiment classification tasks in low-resource languages such as Marathi. This study contributes to the growing field of NLP for regional languages and provides a foundational approach for further research and development in sentiment analysis systems.
